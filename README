Analog composite video simulation (for retro video-like video production).

The reason for this project is to provide the internet a better simulation
of composite video-based emulation, especially for the rash of people on
YouTube who all have their own ideas on what VHS artifacts looks like.

This code uses FFMPEG 3.x to read and write video. It's written for Linux,
but you could compile it (and FFMPEG) for Mac OS X as well if you tried.
